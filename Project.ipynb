    "Restaurants play a major role in the business, intellectual, social and artistic life of a society. To get into a restaurant business, one need to have a proper business plan and background analysis to seek investors attention.

This is valuable as one can get in-depth information regarding a restaurant from other customers for a very low efforts and search costs. It is always better to have a thorough analysis of the market before getiing into the business.\n",

    "We are assuming ourselves as a consulting firm who would provide valuable insights and analysis to the individuals who are planning to start a new restaurant in Banglore city.

We also built predictive models that helps in determining a restaurants success(customer ratings) based on the business plan.\n",

    "For this analysis, we have used an open source dataset scrapped from Zomato available in Kaggle."

To begin with, I will say the phulkas were soft and nice. It goes well with both the gravies. Dal was watery though!! Rice also goes well with both the gravy's, but it tastes better with Paneer gravy. Paneer pieces were not soft. It was a little hard. Curd tasted nice!

Tried their vegetarian sushi and it was pretty good. Also had their steamed rice and Thai curry which were good. The service was very nice - our order took a reasonable amount of time and they were helpful in suggesting what to order. The ambience is nice and there's a lot of space. Would like to visit again!\"), ('Rated 4.0', \"RATED\\n  Can't say this enough, but we do need more places like these in South Bangalore. :) Wamama is an understated, nicely done restaurant, offering Asian cuisine. We ended up going here on a rainy evening. \\n\\nMy experience: They have few select items for each cuisine, be it Japanese, Chinese, Malaysian, Thai etc. We had the Chinese Bao as a starter. Very warm, soft and the flavours were bang on. We had the grill plate as our main course, with the Chicken in chilli garlic and Singaporean noodles and Basa in yellow curry. Both amazing to taste and the quantity for each was more than enough for two people. \\n\\nThe service was very good, with amicable servers.

A roof top cafe kind of ambiance with lush green decor.\\nWe went around 3pm and ordered Mushroom Manchurian, Manchow Soup, Bol Choy & Tofu Dumpling and Wamama Special Bao. To be precise, they got authentic Pan Asian and Indo Chinese dishes as well. We loved all the dishes except Bok Choy & Tofu Dumpling, seems like it was steamed more than the actual time.

We had the Nachos, cheese and salsa. The mayo along with this was so runny and milky. The cheese was only on the top layer and the below ones didn't have any. Next up, my friend and I tried the pink sauce pasta. The pasta was overcooked. The sauce wasn't creamy at all. It lacked in taste. It had garlic bread along with it and it tasted decently.
